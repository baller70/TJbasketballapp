## Implementation Details

### **Database Structure**
- Uses existing `User` model with parent-child relationships
- `parentId` field links children to their parents
- Parent emails are used for notifications

### **Email Service**
- Uses Resend API for reliable email delivery
- Configured in `lib/resend.ts`
- Supports both configured and mock modes
- Graceful fallback if email service is not configured

### **Integration Points**
1. **Drill Completion**: `/api/drills/complete` endpoint
2. **Workout Completion**: `/api/workouts/complete` endpoint

### **Email Templates**
- **Drill Completion**: Orange-themed template with drill details
- **Workout Completion**: Green-themed template with workout summary
- Responsive HTML design with inline CSS
- Includes branding and clear call-to-action

## Configuration

### **Environment Variables**
```bash
RESEND_API_KEY=your-resend-api-key-here
```

### **Email Domains**

## Usage

### **Automatic Notifications**
- No manual intervention required
- Notifications are sent automatically when:
  - A child completes a drill
  - A child completes a workout
  - Parent email is available in the system

### **Error Handling**

- Errors are logged for debugging
- Graceful degradation if email service is unavailable

## Testing

```bash
node test-email.js
```

### **Mock Mode**
