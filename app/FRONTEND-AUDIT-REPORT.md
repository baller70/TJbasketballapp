### Specific Examples
```tsx
// Good accessibility patterns found:
<input aria-label="Receive notifications for all drill and workout completions" />
<div role="region" aria-roledescription="carousel" />
<Button><span className="sr-only">Previous slide</span></Button>
```

### Recommendations
1. **Color Contrast:** Verify basketball orange/blue theme meets WCAG AA standards
